About Me:
<p>
  The General Electric GE90 is a family of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines built by GE Aerospace for the Boeing 777, with thrust ratings from 81,000 to 115,000 pounds-force (360 to 510 kilonewtons). It entered service with British Airways in November 1995. It is one of three engines for the 777-200 and -200ER, and the exclusive engine of the -200LR, -300ER, and 777F. It was the largest jet engine,[3] until being surpassed in January 2020 by its successor, the 110,000 lbf (490 kN) GE9X, which has a larger fan diameter by 6 inches (15 cm). However, the GE90-115B, the most recent variant of the GE90, is rated for a higher thrust (115,000 lbs) than the GE9X.
